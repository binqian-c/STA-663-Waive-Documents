According to the article, one difference between how computers and humans learn is that humans can self-correct and learn the knowledge from some related content, while computers can not self-correct and can only learn precise and direct knowledge. To be more specific, a computer can only call from the pattern it learned before, and if the “new” content does not follow the pattern it learned, the computer would not be able to understand or process the information accurately. However, for humans, we are able to infer the “new” content with the background knowledge we learned before and try to make relation with the previous knowledge, even though the “new” content does not follow the pattern of our background knowledge. And the article also mentions that what NELL is trying to do is that it tries to learn and operate the way humans do, which is to process accurately through making relation with its background knowledge. But there is one minimal similarity between computers and humans that both of us could call from memory. With the premise that there is something already stored in the computer, for example using the assembly language, we have the “storen” and “call & jumpr” function to call from the memory address. This is similar to how humans recite things and then call from their memory some day in the future. Also, in Pythons, suppose we have already written a helper function and then use that helper function to write another function, which is similar to how we solve problems based on the solution we already had before.
