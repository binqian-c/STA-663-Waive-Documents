PS 4: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.
I partially agree with Kurzweil’s vision of the future because I think technology is a positive force in human development but might have some potential negative effects. I think the main parts of human developments are to live longer and to live better, and undoubtedly technology is helping us to achieve what we are pursuing. There is some news today about how technology development makes progress in scientific fields, medical fields, and so on. For example, people are trying to use 3D print organs in organ transplant operations to solve the issue of organ donation shortage and other moral issues about donation. However, like mentioned in the article, phone memo helps people to memorize phone numbers, which I think might have potential negative effects such as memory degradation. Also, as technology has done most of the things for us, our capabilities may degrade and we may become extremely addictive to technology. I believe there are many people who have the same concerns with me and might try to find an alternative way of developing technology to avoid Kurzweil’s prediction that computers are going to trump people. Last but not least, as the article mentioned that Watson could answer those questions because it has read a lot, more than a human could do, but does not understand the implication of what it is reading. So I think it may take longer than Kurzweil’s expectation, or may be impossible, for the computer to “truly understand” and think like a human being.
