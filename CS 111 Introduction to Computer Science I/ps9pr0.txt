Problem Set 9: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.
I think pivot searching would be largely and widely used in the future because it seems to be a very helpful tool for us according to the article. Just like what the second prompt mentioned, pivot searching is helpful to doctors “to search on the context (symptoms) of other patients, thus discovering diagnoses, treatments and other relevant information,” or does a favor to lawyers, allowing them to “leverage a context search tool based on cases”. Also, pivot searching would be helpful in everyday use. For example, as a student, I sometimes would like to delete some documents I wrote because I think I will not use it for the rest of the semester and I could save more space in my computer for storing other documents. But I sometimes need to reread the deleted documents a few years later. And thus pivot searching could help me to recall what the deleted documents are about. Besides, like the article mentioned, pivot searching does not occupy much room on the computer. Therefore, I think pivot searching might become an “everyday necessity” for us in the future after seeing the benefits behind it. But like what the article pointed out, privacy is a big challenge that pivot searching is facing. Many people might be worried about this issue. So do I. However, if this privacy issue is solved, I believe pivot searching would become widely used and accepted by almost everyone.
