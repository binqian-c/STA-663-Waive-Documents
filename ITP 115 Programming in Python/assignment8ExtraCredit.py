# Assignment 8 Extra Credit: Print Pretty Board
# This program is about defining and calling functions with a helper file.
# This program simulates the game of Tic Tac Toe with either player x or player o alternatively taking a turn.
# The program will update the 3*3 board after each player's turn.
# The program will finally display the message telling who is the winner or whether stalemate is reached.
# The Tic Tac Toe game will be kept playing until the user wants to quit by entering letter other than "y".
